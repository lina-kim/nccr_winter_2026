    "The Google Colab notebook environment will interpret any command as Python code by default. If we want to run shell commands, we will have to prefix them by `!`. So any command you see with a leading `!` is a shell command and if you wanted to run it in your terminal you would omit the leading `!`. For example, if in the Colab notebook you ran `!wget` you would just run `wget` in your terminal."
